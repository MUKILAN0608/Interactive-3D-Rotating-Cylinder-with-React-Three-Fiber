This React project uses React Three Fiber and @react-three/drei to render a 3D scene featuring a rotating blue cylinder. The scene includes interactive OrbitControls for navigation, a directional light for illumination, and Sparkles for visual effects. The cylinder continuously rotates along the Y and Z axes using the useFrame hook. The Canvas component is styled to cover the full viewport, creating an immersive experience.
